# Spiroids

Some spirally Spiroid things will spin around the window. Eventually they might be like boids.

It uses [Gosu](https://www.libgosu.org) and I made it because of [Cory](https://github.com/chamblin)'s RubyConf [talk about writing games in Ruby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK9RX_CzCeI).
